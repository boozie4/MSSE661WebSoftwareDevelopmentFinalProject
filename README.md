# Little Steps, Big Growth: Whole Family Coaching

<h2>This project is being created as my final project for MSSE 661 Web Software Development</h2>
<h2>Regis University</h2>

<p>The purpose of this website is to offer resources and services to parents and families who desire support and coaching on improving relationships within 
the family. There are many different events and situations in life that may be difficult to navigate. Little Steps, Big Growth is here to guide and support your whole 
family through these hard to navigate situations.</p>

<p>Features of the website:</p> 
<ul>
  <li>My account page with secure login</li>
  <li>List of offered resources and services</li>
  <li>Upcoming events page with the ability to register for events</li>
  <li>Easy to follow layout</li>
</ul>

<p>Languages and plugins used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>NodeJS</li>
  <li>Express</li>
  <li>MySQL</li>
</ul>

<p>As I have worked on develpment of this project, the name of the website has changed from "The Parenting Coach" to "Little Steps, Big Growth: Whole Family Coaching".
This change feels like it better represents the purpose of this project and the services and resources that will be provided.</p>
