<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I propose to create a web application titled "The Parent Coach". This application will be a page
where parents can go and choose from a viriety of topics. These topics will include any area in parenting
in which they feel they need support or coaching. Parents who visit the site can browse the topics without
creating a login. However, if they decide they would like to utilize any of the teaching material, they must
create a profile with login credentials. </p>
